# Neural Simulations in Python 

Showcasing the work I've done in simulating the various neural circuits/networks in the brain. Research work done at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in my senior year of high school.

## Description

Intrigued by the brain, I wanted to learn more about the physiology of its functionality. Working with Dr. Elizabeth Ryder, a professor of Computational Biology at WPI, I realized that simulating its functions is an excellent way to eliminate the mysteries and get a better understanding of the brain. This website showcases all the simulations I've done so far, while also presenting the information I learned in a clear and concise manner in the hopes that it will be of use to others.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python3
* pip
* All other dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file and can be installed using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Program

* After all the dependencies are installed, run the command `streamlit run App.py` to start the server.
* The website will be hosted on `localhost:8501`

## Acknowledgments
* Dr. Elizabeth Ryder for her guidance and support on this project
* Worcester Polytechnic Institute for providing me with the resources and opportunity to work on this project
